As you've get familiar with using Bootstrap's document, we'll start with it. Just
peek in the Content menu on the left sidebar of the Bootstrap's official website.

[getbootstrap.com -> Documentation -> Content](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/ "ext")

Wew, there are only a few things appear in the sub-menu. Since the most common
content types in almost every websites are `text` and `image`, Bootstrap's
Content toolsets are all about those 2 content types. The most frequently used
toolset is the one related to `Typography`. Let's see what we have in this toolset.

As building the next 2 parts of the sample webpage will require some classes in
this toolset. I recommend you to take some time reading the following sections
in the document:

- Headings
- Display headings
- Lead
- Blockquotes

The first section is `Headings`; It's about common styles of heading tags
pre-defined by Bootstrap. They also offer heading `classes` which can make a
`<p>` element look like a heading.

Next one is `Display headings`; This section contains some classes which are
pre-defined with a display font. If you're not familiar with design stuff, then
a display font is a strong typeface which will strongly attract user's eyes.
Normally, these utilities will be very nice to sit on front-pages.

Let's write a piece of code to see the difference between `heading` classes
and `display heading` classes. We'll also use the class `lead` which makes a
paragraph stand out.
