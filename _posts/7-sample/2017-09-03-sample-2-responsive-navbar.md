Before starting this tutorial, let me assume that youâ€™ve come from the CSS series
on my website. So, we've collected some new tools to use in this tutorial:

- Knowing all CSS Selectors and where to find documents about them. Because we
won't try to remember everything. :D
- Pseudo-classes.
- Margin & padding properties.
- Media query syntax.

And... here is the expected result:

`On mobile devices:`
![mobile](/images/sample/2/mobile.png)

This tutorial is just an example, you should give the navigation bar your own
style (size, color, font, etc...).

## 1. Let's get it started

Firstly, let's construct the navigation bar with a `<nav>` container and its 3
children: logo and 2 lists of links.

`HTML code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/ad746b59ff7ca6812d580841f0f363a1.js">
</script>

There's something `strange` here, a new `<meta> tag` related to `viewport`. This
tag is used to tell web browsers that content of this website should never be
scaled smaller. And so, for all the websites which show tiny texts on mobile
devices are just missing the meta tag.

Next, let's add some navigation links and social links. We also assume that
these links will have same styles (size, text color, hover effect, ...). So,
we're gonna group them using a nice class name: `nav-link`.

`HTML code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/3b33f0638887dbf67505fbdfb0a48b4d.js">
</script>

## 2. Styling target large screen devices

Many people on the Earth will tell you that you should write CSS code target
mobile devices firstly (mobile first design). But, there's no fixed rule. In
this tutorial, we're gonna write CSS target large screen devices before
taking care of mobile devices.

This task can be divided in sub-tasks:

1. Laying out 2 lists of links to make them stay in a same row, and pulling one to the right.
2. Coloring stuff, and sizing up all the links.
3. Adding hover-effect to all the links (excluded the logo).

### 2.1 Laying out link-lists

By default, the two link-list wrapped using `<div> tag` will have the property
`display: block` and does not allow them to stay in a row with the logo `.navbar-brand`.
Let's fix this.

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/cc945e514b6a1a007b079ba0dc0f2fd6.js">
</script>

To pull the `.navbar-right` to the right, the simple solution is using
`position: absolute` and set position of the list base on its parent `.navbar`.

You can also consider to pin the navigation bar on top of the viewport by using
`position: fixed`; Or if not, just make it `position: relative` so we can set
position of the `.navbar-right`.

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/33ed7a147f1e254823501cb326d15bcc.js">
</script>

### 2.2 Coloring & Sizing

Colors first, as they help our eyes to notice elements' sizes. We're gonna remove
links' underlines as well.

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/d4f03a947e58fae1b9482c8f4ddd1d75.js">
</script>

To size up all the links, we'll use `padding` instead of `width & height` properties.
This makes their sizes flexible; So, we don't have to care about if the inner
texts are long or short.

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/86c902d385ec7f3806c30ad3e59e13f9.js">
</script>

### 2.3 Adding hover-effect

I love subtle effects and am using the one which is used by Github's website.
When user hovers mouse over a link, text color will just dim a little bit. Just
exclude the logo.

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/98a7723702d784e83b5f1de2c6a05a78.js">
</script>

## 3. Styling target mobile devices

Now, it's time to use media query syntax. I'll just create only 1 break point at
`842px`. You can create more break points if you feel that it's needed.

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/7944e3ce889b538caa81d7453c64b380.js">
</script>

Before discussing what we need to do, let's resize your web browser to see how
the navigation bar will look like on mobile devices.

`Screenshot:`
![desktop](/images/sample/2/non-responsive.png)

Todos:

1. Make the two lists of links displayed vertical
2. Make the navigation bar toggleable (collapse/expand)
3. Add a toggler-button to the right corner or the navigation bar

### 3.1 Make the two link-lists vertical

In the previous sections, we've make the two lists of links and all anchor elements
`inline-block`; And we also set position of the second list to the right using
`position: absolute`. Just override these two properties.

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/abc23cead06f61d80b7e8ccb8eade7f9.js">
</script>

### 3.2 Make the navigation bar toggleable

Normally, this task will be handled by using another language called JavaScript.
As we've not met JS yet, then we'll make it the CSS way by using a
[checkbox](https://codenart.github.io/html/2017/07/27/html-8-other-inputs.html#2-radio-button--check-box--dropdown-list "ext")
as an indicator; And we'll use the pseudo-class `:checked` to change size of the
navigation bar base on the indicator's state.

`HTML code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/d37580cf274527eb03cbe708604c3b51.js">
</script>

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/bf65eccd3698d66d159ade26950ce774.js">
</script>

That's it. If the checkbox is checked, it means the navigation bar is collapsed.
Now we can toggle the navigation bar by checking/unchecking the checkbox.

### 3.3 Add a toggler-button to the right

We all know that checkbox is not friendly to mobile users. It's hard to tap such
a tiny box. The solution is to hide the checkbox and use a
[label element](https://codenart.github.io/html/2017/07/27/html-8-other-inputs.html#the-label-tags "ext")
as a button to toggle the checkbox.

We also want to make the checkbox and the button hidden to large screen devices.
So, remember to move a piece of code to outside of the media query block.

`HTML code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/33565c9478091df036f391e8d4cfb505.js">
</script>

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/c17c61318cf1223973ddc87a41756c60.js">
</script>

## 4. Cleaning up code

Congrazz!!! You've created a responsive navigation bar! You're awesome. :D

You may also want to add some borders to separate components like the toggler-button
and the two lists of links before cleaning up your code and merge classes' styles.

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/8f17f985162759d1b84f7c0989a204bc.js">
</script>

- [CSS code](https://gist.github.com/codenart/e6db5ad240d89f42525c4eacd2c27543 "ext")

## 5. Conclusion

It takes ~100 lines of CSS code to create the navigation bar. You've done a
serious work. But we can even make it better in future:

- The navigation bar is lack of animation/transition when it's toggled.
- It's also lack of icons set as we've use text to describe social links. Oh,
not really. Maybe you love words over icons as I do.

Ready to learn more and create better? :D  
Let's go back to our unfinished CSS tutorial. There're many interesting stuff
waiting for us.
