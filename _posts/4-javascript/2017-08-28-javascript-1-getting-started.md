Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a programming language. With JavaScript, you
can teach the computer to think and make decision base on input data. For example,
you want to place a button on your webpage to greet user when he/she clicks on
it. HTML can only help to make the button shown up. CSS can only help to make the
button look nice. But, none of those two language can tell web browser `what to
do` when user clicks on the button. This is the point where JavaScript gets in.
That's it.

<button class="btn btn-success" id="greet">
   Click me! I'll greet you. :D
</button>

Wanna see something made with JavaScript? :D
