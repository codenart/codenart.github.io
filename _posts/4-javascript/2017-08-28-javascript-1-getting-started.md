Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a programming language. With JavaScript, you
can teach the computer to think and make decision base on input data. For example,
you want to place a button on your webpage to greet user when he/she clicks on
it. HTML can help to make the button shown up. CSS can help to make the button
look nice. But, none of those two languages can tell web browser `what to do`
when user clicks on the button. This is the point where JavaScript gets in.

`HTML code:`

`CSS code:`

`JS code:`

`Result:`

<button class="btn btn-success" id="greet">
   Click me! I'll greet you. :D
</button>
