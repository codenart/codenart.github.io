This is the biggest built-in object of web browser, also referred as BOM (Browser
Object Model). So, it's in-built and there must be a document somewhere with all
of its bundled stuff listed. Here they are:

- [Bundled variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window#Properties)
- [Bundled functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window#Methods)

Since our minds are very limited, they're just vehicles which are designed to
travel in the reality, so trying to remember everything using the minds is just
a worst idea ever. Let's take it easy by just having a gentle introduction to
`what there are` in the document. We'll just care about some important stuff and
save the reference links for later use.
