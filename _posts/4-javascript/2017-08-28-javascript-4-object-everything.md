short: Object & Everything

Whenever we lower down vibration to identify with the intellect which is the
inferior dimension of the mind, everything seems to be separated and definable
as objects. Anything can be defined by some properties and abilities. For example:
A tree can be considered as an object which has name, age, and ability to produce.

To reflect this dimension of the mind into programming, the first programmers of
the world decided to allow modelling objects in code. This makes programming more
friendly and gives people more possibilities to turn their ideas into code. Let's
have a look at the example below.

`JS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/3f26eff5db309303e01fa8a9823e3b4b.js">
</script>

Here we have an object stored in the variable `theTree`. An object in JavaScript
is just a bundle of `variables` and `functions` enclosed by a couple of curly
braces `{}`. The variables `name` and `age` are used to describe the tree's
properties. On the other hand, the function `produce` is used to describe its
ability to yield fruits.

Please take note that we don't need to use the keywords `var` and `function` for
bundled variables and functions of an object. Normally, when referring to
object, the variables are called `properties` and the functions are called
`methods`. But, it's just the words matter, isn't it? We're gonna keep calling
them `variables` and `functions` because they're just that.

To access the bundled variables and functions, a dot `.` is used to chain the
object's reference and bundled stuff. This is it! The dot which was mentioned in our
[first tutorial](https://codenart.github.io/smart/#the-baby-first-javascript-statements).
We've used it many times with the statement `console.log()`. The `console` itself
is an object; And the function `log` is actually bundled in the object.

## Referring from the inside

In the section above, we've used the variable `theTree` to store the object's
reference; Then access bundled stuff of the object from outside by calling the
variable `theTree`. To use the object's reference from the inside, the keyword
`this` is used to refer to the object itself.

`JS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/0150dfbe42873ef9e298238d801e0673.js">

## Everything in JavaScript is Object

Not really. But, in fact, JavaScript treats everything as Object.
