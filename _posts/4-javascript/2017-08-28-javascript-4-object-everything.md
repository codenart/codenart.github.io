Whenever we low down vibration to identify with the intellect which is the inferior
dimension of the mind, all things seems to be separated and definable as objects.
Anything can be defined by some properties and abilities. For example: A tree
can may be considered as an object which has name, age, and ability to produce.

To reflect this dimension of the mind into programming, the first programmers of
the world decided to allow people to model objects in code. This makes programming
more friendly and gives people more possibilities to turn their ideas into code.
Let's have a look at the example below.

`JS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/3f26eff5db309303e01fa8a9823e3b4b.js">
</script>
