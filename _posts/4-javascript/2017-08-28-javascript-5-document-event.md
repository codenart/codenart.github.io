About manipulating HTML document, the object `document` offers some possibilities
as listed below:

1. Finding and modifying specific HTML elements
2. Creating new elements and altering document's structure
3. Binding event listeners/actions to make components become interactive

Along with exploring the object `document`, we'll apply some of its features to
create a dropdown. I've prepared HTML and CSS code so we can just start talking
about JS stuff. Please just copy the code snippets below to your sample HTML
document and CSS file; And create a blank JS file linked to the HTML document.

`HTML code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/ef2d53f28af5dc19d7b6f96edfbbbebe.js">
</script>

`CSS code:`

And here is the expected result with the dropdown working properly.

<p data-height="500" data-theme-id="light"
   data-slug-hash="LrQXGj" data-default-tab="result" data-user="codenart"
   data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="A weird dropdown :D" class="codepen">
   See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/codenart/pen/LrQXGj/">A weird dropdown :D</a>
   by Kei Nart (<a href="https://codepen.io/codenart">@codenart</a>) on
   <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

You may notice that the dropdown is a little weird. Normally, a dropdown has only
1 button but the dropdown we're working with comes with 2 buttons. We'll talk
about this at the end of the tutorial. And please don't peek in the JS source
code on CodePen. We're gonna make it from scratch. It's so simple and won't take
much time. :D
