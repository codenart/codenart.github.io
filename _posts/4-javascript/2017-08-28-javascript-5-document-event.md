About manipulating HTML document, it includes the following possibilities that
the object `document` offers:

- Finding and modifying specific HTML elements
- Creating new elements and altering document's structure
- Binding event listeners/actions to make components become interactive

Along with learning the object `document`, we'll apply some of its featured to
create a dropdown. I have prepared the HTML and CSS code of the dropdown. It
will be a little weird because it will have 2 buttons: 1 for showing the
`dropdown-list` and the another one for hiding it.

Please just copy the code snippets below to your sample HTML document and CSS
file; Also create a blank JS file and link it to the HTML document so we can
start writing JS code now.

`HTML code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/ef2d53f28af5dc19d7b6f96edfbbbebe.js">
</script>

`CSS code:`
[Click here to see CSS code](https://gist.github.com/codenart/e35ac23245ec8d2d506c280cd6751ef2#file-dropdown-css)

And here is the expected result with the dropdown working properly.

<p data-height="500" data-theme-id="light"
   data-slug-hash="LrQXGj" data-default-tab="result" data-user="codenart"
   data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="A weird dropdown :D" class="codepen">

   <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.

<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Please do not peek in the JS source code on CodePen. We're gonna make it from
scratch. It's so simple and won't take much time. :D
