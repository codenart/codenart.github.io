Before starting our tutorial, let's have a look at the reference links which have
all the bundled stuff of the object fully listed.

- [Bundled variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document#Properties)
- [Bundled functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document#Methods)

Too much information, right? Don't try to remember everything. Nobody should do
that. You should only parse the information to see what utilities the object offer;
And we'll pick up some common stuff to make examples.
