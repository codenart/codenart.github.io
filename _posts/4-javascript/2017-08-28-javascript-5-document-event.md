About manipulating HTML document, the object `document` offers some possibilities
as listed below:

- Finding and modifying specific HTML elements
- Creating new elements and altering document's structure
- Binding event listeners/actions to make components become interactive

Along with exploring the object `document`, we'll apply some of its features to
create a dropdown. I've prepared HTML and CSS code so we can just start talking
about JS stuff. Please just copy the code snippets below to your sample HTML
document and CSS file; Also create a blank JS file and link it to the HTML document.

`HTML code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/ef2d53f28af5dc19d7b6f96edfbbbebe.js">
</script>

`CSS code:`
[Click here to see CSS code](https://gist.github.com/codenart/e35ac23245ec8d2d506c280cd6751ef2#file-dropdown-css)

And here is the expected result with the dropdown working properly.

<p data-height="500" data-theme-id="light"
   data-slug-hash="LrQXGj" data-default-tab="result" data-user="codenart"
   data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="A weird dropdown :D" class="codepen">
   See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/codenart/pen/LrQXGj/">A weird dropdown :D</a>
   by Kei Nart (<a href="https://codepen.io/codenart">@codenart</a>) on
   <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

I know that the dropdown is a little weird. Normally, a dropdown has only 1 button
but the dropdown we're working with comes with 2 buttons. And we'll talk about
this point later. Please do not peek in the JS source code on CodePen. We're
gonna make it from scratch. It's so simple and won't take much time. :D
