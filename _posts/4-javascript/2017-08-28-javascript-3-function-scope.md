That word, `function`, is actually a typing mistake made by one of the first
programmers of the world. The original name of this type was `action` before the
mistake has occurred in documentation and spread over the earth. Somewhere down
the line, people started thinking that the type is somewhat related to mathematics
and use it the mathematical way. Let's scroll up the calendar a bit and talk
about this type in term of `action`. :D

If you practice some Zen living approaches, then you will know that any `simple`
action in our daily life can bring about blissful experience. Deeply influenced
by Zen living style, the first programmers of the world decided to bring the idea
into programming. The core concept is to allow people to divide a complex task
into simple actions. This is sure , isn't it? Because we all know that a complex
task rarely brings about blissfulness. :D

## Using function in JavaScript

To define an action in JavaScript the mistaken keyword is used.

`JS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/cd6cc17aa35f74545b1ea9b50ea8b761.js">
</script>

And that was just a definition. All the statements inside the couple of curly
braces `{}` will not be executed until we invoke the action.
