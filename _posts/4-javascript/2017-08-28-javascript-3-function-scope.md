That word, `function`, is actually a typing mistake made by one of the first
programmers of the world. The original name of this type was `action` before the
mistake has occurred in documentation and spread over the earth. Somewhere down
the line, people started thinking that the type is somewhat related to mathematics
and use it the mathematical way. Let's scroll up the calendar a bit and talk
about this type in term of `action`. :D

If you practice some Zen living approaches, then you will know that any `simple`
action in our daily life can bring about blissful experience. Deeply influenced
by Zen living style, the first programmers of the world have decided to bring
the idea into programming. The core concept is to allow people to divide a complex
task into simple actions. This is sure good; Because we all know that a complex
task rarely brings about blissfulness. :D
