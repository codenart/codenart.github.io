The HTML tags which are called text formatters can be categorized into 2 groups:

- `Semantic` formatters
- `Non-semantic` formatters

The semantic formatters tell web browsers how the contents should look like.
They also tell search engines (Google, Bing, etc...) what the contents are, or
how important the contents are.

Here are common semantic formatters:

`Sample code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/0caa47c78c60f8d8c0551896a7524048.js">
</script>

`Result:`

**This content is Important and should look Bold**  
*This content is Important and should look Italicized*  
~~This content is noted that it's Not accurate and Deleted~~  
<sub>subscript</sub> 8 <sup>superscript</sup>

## Non-semantic text formatters

Non-semantic formatters only tell web browsers how the contents should look
like. They do not describe the contents, neither tell search engines anything.

Here are common Non-semantic formatters:

`Sample code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/22643c17d0fe52f8e0c7a85f2d26675e.js">
</script>

`Result:`

**This content should look Bold**  
*This content should look Italicized*  
<u>This content should look Underlined</u>
