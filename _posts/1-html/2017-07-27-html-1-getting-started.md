Forget about technical and academic views. We go online everyday. We can start
at homepage of [a website](https://medium.com/ "ext") and explore thousands of
its pages. That's it.

> A website is a collection of many webpages.  
> \_\_A simple & happy Mind

So if you want to create a website, just start it simply by learning how to
create a single webpage.

## How to create a webpage?

It's pretty much like how a `file` named something like `fountain.docx` can be
opened by [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word "ext")
or [LibreOffice Writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Writer "ext").
There's a specific type of document which is preferred by
[Web Browsers](#how-to-create-a-webpage "int")
called `HTML document` and the document's filename looks like this: `fountain.html`

> A webpage is nothing but a text document which can be opened by web browsers.  
> \_\_A simple & happy Mind

And... we can create HTML documents using a simple text editor like
[Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad "ext").  
Let's create one:
- Open your Notepad.
- Put there some nice words.
- Save file as `yoursite.html`
- Open the document using your web browser.

That's it. You've created a webpage. And if you put this webpage somewhere on
the internet that people can reach it, then you have your very first website.

I've found [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "ext") is totally free and excellent.
You can take a couple of minutes to take your simple website online then come
back here to continue our tutorial.  
Go for it.

## How to add images, buttons, etc...?

As you see that web browsers are excellent presenters. We can tell them to show
any kind of contents. But, in order to talk to them, we have to speak their
language. They speak HTML, a simple and easy-to-learn language.

> HTML is a simplified version of English.  
> \_\_A simple & happy Mind

Let's change our simple webpage a little bit. We're gonna put there a `heading`, a
`paragraph` and a `button`:

- Copy/Paste the ancient text below into your HTML document.
- Save file again.
- Refresh your web browser.

`Sample code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/233e004d03d3e9ec33cf593881c8f23c.js"></script>

`Screenshot:`
![html document using tags](/images/html-1/hope.jpg)

That is HTML!  
We simply surround everything with couples of `tags` and web browsers can
somehow understand
[what](#how-to-add-images-buttons-etc "int")
we want them to present. You may notice that every `HTML tag` has its own name
that describes the enclosed contents:

- `button` is clearly to tell that we want a
[button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button "ext")
to show up.
- `p` stands for
[paragraph](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p "ext").
- `h1` means
[heading level 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements "ext").

And there are plenty of
[HTML tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element "ext") which
help us to put anything on our website.

> Learning HTML is just about trying some new tags and refreshing web browser.  
> \_\_A simple & happy Mind

But typing those angle brackets `<>` and repeated tags' name is a `boring` task.

## How to have fun doing a boring task?

You know, we're living in a `magical` world. Great people keep sharing free and
useful stuff to make life easier. I've found another free and excellent `thing`
created by Github - the [Atom Code Editor](https://atom.io/ "ext"):

1. One click to [download](https://atom.io/ "ext").
2. Another one to install.
3. Then we can write HTML like a `magician` (not a coder).

> Free is beyond good.  
> \_\_A simple & happy Mind

Take a couple of minutes to get [Atom](https://atom.io/ "ext") installed on your
computer then we will see `him` in action. The word [Atom](https://atom.io/ "ext")
means `actor`, doesn't it? :D

Once you have Atom ready at your hand... there's another important `thing` need
to be done before we go to the our next tutorial.  
It's [Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaw2Za2SUy4 "ext")!
