We all know that
[HTML](https://codenart.github.io/begin/#how-to-add-images-buttons-etc "ext") is
a simplified version of English. It helps us to talk to web browsers. With HTML,
we can tell web browsers to display any type of contents (links, images, buttons,
etc...). But none of HTML tags can help us to tell web browsers how to display
those content aesthetically.

There is no disappointment in this truth. HTML is too simple both to learn and
to use. That's why it cannot help us to fulfill too many purposes. Everything has
its own use and limit. Fire can give us life and knowledge but we also need
healing and wisdom from Water. And
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS "ext") is there to
embrace HTML. <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>

Ok. Fair enough. :D  
This is a shorter introduction to CSS:

- CSS is another simplified version of English.
- CSS helps us to make our webpages look nicer.
- Learning CSS is easy and so much much much fun. :D :D :D

Oh. I'm not saying that the second screenshot looks nicer than the first one. Cause
I don't have good sense of using colors and design stuff. But I assure you that
CSS can help you to make your webpages look nicer and more lively than black and
white text documents. :D

## How does CSS code look like?

`Sample code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/4b52fbda1a1252823a9dc32cacfef883.js">
</script>

Do you feel that CSS code looks more `English` than HTML? :D

Let me explain a little bit about the sample CSS code snippet above:

- There are 3 blocks of CSS code in the example. Each block has a couple of curly
braces `{}` to group something. :D
- Right before each `{}` there is a `selector`. Selectors helps us to select the
HTML elements that we want to decorate.
- Inside each `{}`, there are some CSS rules which tell web browsers how to
display the selected HTML elements. In the example above: white text, background
color is crimson, sizes of letters.
- Each CSS rule ends with a semi-colon `;` and has 2 parts separated by a colon `:`
- The left part is a `property` of the selected elements which we want to make change.
- The right part is a `value` which we want to apply to the property.

## Where to put CSS code?

It's easier done than said. (Is this a correct sentence? :D)  
Just do this:

- Use Atom to create 2 files and place them in the same folder.
- An HTML document named `simple.html`
- And another file named `beauty.css`

In the HTML document, right before the ending tag `</head>`, create a `<link>`
element that point to the CSS file:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="beauty.css">`

We're gonna create a simple message with white text and red background:
- In the HTML document, add an `h1` with this sentence: `Simple is beautiful .`
- In the CSS file... please copy the CSS code snippet below into your CSS file. :D

`HTML code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/25caa2f56814e72e174bf76f263ba8b0.js">
</script>

`CSS code:`
<script src="https://gist.github.com/codenart/0b5e434dc57ca6e4354bc940dad041b8.js">
</script>

`Result:`

<p data-height="500" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="YrzaGG" data-default-tab="result"
   data-user="codenart" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="The beauty of simplicity"
   class="codepen">

I believe that you've found CSS is so easy to understand. There's no tricky stuff
here. CSS is just that simple. Are you ready to learn more about CSS Selectors,
Properties and Values?
